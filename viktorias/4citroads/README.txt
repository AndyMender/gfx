The textures all created by me with Gimp.

The blend file contains a script wich renders the roads the way it is required by the game.

Please note:
Al the road pices are 1x1 blender unit squares. 
If I render it with camera settings:
  -Orthographic scale: 1.41
  -Shift X=0, Y=-0.501
the square perfectly fits the camera but there are gaps beetween the roads in the game!

If I render it with camera settings:
  -Orthographic scale: 1.35
  -Shift X=0, Y=-0.524
the square a bit larger then the camera but there are NO gaps beetween the roads in the game!
So I have rendered all the roads with this setting!
